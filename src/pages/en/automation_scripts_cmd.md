Users can create and manage unlimited agents using local ES5 JavaScript files (the *Agent's script*). These can be tracked and synced with a running **Kubeshark** instance using the CLI.

### Prerequisites

Install the `kubeshark` CLI using a method from the [installation guide](/en/install).

Assume a file named `anomaly-agent.js` is located at:

```
/Users/me/agents/anomaly-agent.js
```

### Track All Files in a Folder

```shell
kubeshark scripts --set scripting.source=/Users/me/agents/
```

### Track Individual Files

```shell
kubeshark scripts --set scripting.sources[0]=/Users/me/agents/anomaly-agent.js 
```

Any change to a tracked file will be synchronized with the running **Kubeshark** instance.
Adding a new file or deleting an existing one is also treated as a change and will be synced with the deployed **Kubeshark** instance.

### Determining the Agent Name

The CLI extracts the agent name from the first line of the *Agent's script* (as a comment).
Example name: `API Call Anomaly Detection Script`

## Environment Variables

*Agent scripts* can access environment variables set in the configuration.

Example:

```yaml
scripting:
  env:
    ZAP_SERVER_URL: https://a6a4...-free.app
    ZAP_APIKEY: shshh
    AWS_REGION: us-east-1
    S3_BUCKET: vol-ks...d-demo
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "AK...N"
    # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "xZ...ie"
    KINESIS_STREAM_NAME: "stream1"
    KINESIS_MIN_BATCH_SIZE: "10"
```
