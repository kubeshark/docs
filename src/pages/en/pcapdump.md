title: L4 (TCP, UDP, SCTP) Traffic Recorder
description: 
layout: ../../layouts/MainLayout.astro
---

**Kubeshark** provides cluster-wide recording of all L4 supported protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, and SCTP) traffic, including [decrypted TLS](http://localhost:3000/en/encrypted_traffic) and mTLS traffic. This functionality is similar to the popular [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/).  

> This functionality is free of charge, with no limitations on cluster size, and does not require a license.

**Kubeshark** automatically and continuously records and stores all captured traffic, managing both time window and storage limits. This enables you to export recorded traffic to your local folder at any time for retention or further analysis using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

To export the recorded traffic locally, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the **Kubeshark** CLI is installed.  
2. Confirm that **Kubeshark** is deployed and running.  
3. Execute one of the following commands:  

```shell
kubeshark pcapdump --dest=/tmp            # Export all PCAP files to a specified local directory
kubeshark pcapdump --dest=/tmp --time=5m  # Export the last 5 minutes of recorded traffic to a specified local directory
kubeshark pcapdump                        # Export all PCAP files to the current directory
kubeshark pcapdump --time=5m              # Export the last 5 minutes of recorded traffic to the current directory
```
> The `kubeshark` CLI can be [installed using homebrew](/en/install#homebrew) or [downloaded from GitHub](https://github.com/kubeshark/kubeshark/releases)

## Advanced Options

### Automatic & Continuous Operation

By default, the `pcapdump` process starts automatically when **Kubeshark** is deployed and [traffic capture](/en/on_off_switch) is enabled. It remains active as long as **Kubeshark** is running unless explicitly stopped.

### Capture Filters

Traffic capture in **Kubeshark** operates based on configurable [capture filters](/en/pod_targeting). Captured traffic is stored in local PCAP files on the Kubernetes nodeâ€™s disk, with time window and storage limits managed automatically.

Example capture filter configuration:

```yaml
tap:
  regex: .*front                    # Capture traffic for pods matching the regex
  namespaces:                       # From the specified namespaces
    - ns1
    - ns2
  excludedNamespaces:               # Exclude traffic from these namespaces
    - ns3
  bpfOverride: "net 0.0.0.0/0"      # Override with a custom BPF expression
```

> Read more about filters in the [capture filters documentation](/en/pod_targeting).

### Time Window and Storage Management

**Kubeshark** ensures efficient management of storage and time limits by discarding older files outside the defined time window or exceeding the storage quota.

For example, with a time window of 24 hours and a storage limit of 50 MB, **Kubeshark** retains files recorded within the last 24 hours as long as the total storage remains under 50 MB. Files exceeding these constraints are automatically deleted.

### Configuration

> While the default configuration is typically sufficient, the following settings can be customized if needed.

You can adjust the `pcapdump` configuration via Helm values:

```yaml
pcapdump:
  enabled: true                     # Enable or disable PCAP recording
  maxTime: 1h                       # Time window for file retention
  maxSize: 50MB                     # Maximum storage limit
```

## `pcapdump` vs. Traffic Recorder

While `pcapdump` and the [Traffic Recorder](/en/traffic_recorder) serve similar purposes, they are designed for different use cases:

- **`pcapdump`**: A lightweight, tcpdump-like utility for capturing PCAP traffic for external analysis in [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). It primarily stores Layer 4 (L4) traffic without Kubernetes context (e.g., pod, service, or namespace names).

- [**Traffic Recorder**](/en/traffic_recorder): Integrated with the **Kubeshark** dashboard, it enables traffic capture and storage for offline analysis. It captures both Layer 4 (L4) and Layer 7 (L7) traffic, along with Kubernetes context.
