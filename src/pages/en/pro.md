### Obtaining an Enterprise POC License

To obtain an Enterprise POC license, you’ll first need an account in the [Admin Console](https://console.kubeshark.co/), which is used to manage licenses. By default, a complimentary Pro license will be provisioned upon sign-up.

Once your account is created, contact us using the [contact-us](https://kubeshark.co/contact-us) form, and provide the email address used to create the Admin Console account. We’ll convert your complimentary Pro license to an Enterprise license and notify you once it’s ready.

To retrieve your license, log in to the [Admin Console](https://console.kubeshark.co/) and follow the provided instructions to properly set it up.
