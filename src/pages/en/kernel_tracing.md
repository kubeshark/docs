Kubeshark offers tracing kernel-space and user-space functions using 🐝 [eBPF](https://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/) (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter). eBPF is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space. It's first introduced into
Linux kernel with version 4.4 and quite matured since then.

## Capturing Unencrypted TLS Traffic

To deploy Kubeshark with TLS sniffing capability, simply add the `--tls` option:

```bash
kubeshark deploy --tls -n sock-shop
```

Kubeshark supports the most commonly used encryption/decryption
library [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library and Go's custom implementation [crypto/tls](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls) package.

> Note: By default the capturing unencrypted TLS traffic. Only `--tls` option enables it.

### OpenSSL

It attaches [uprobe](https://docs.kernel.org/trace/uprobetracer.html)(s)
to [`SSL_read`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_read.html) and [`SSL_write`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_write.html)
functions to simply reads the incoming unencrypted response and outgoing encrypted request in any TLS/SSL connection.

Languages like Python, Java, PHP, Ruby and Node.js use OpenSSL library for their encryption/decryption work. So, pretty
much any program or service that's doing encrypted communication (using TLS) falls into this category.

### Go

Go is a little bit complicated than OpenSSL but the basic principle is the same.

Go language has two ABIs; **ABI0** and **ABIInternal**. We support both **amd64** and **arm64** so that translates into
a good number of offsets to handle.

We basically probe the [`crypto/tls.(*Conn).Read`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.17.6/src/crypto/tls/conn.go#L1263) and
[`crypto/tls.(*Conn).Write`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.17.6/src/crypto/tls/conn.go#L1099) just like OpenSLL's `SSL_read` / `SSL_write` .
In addition to that we disassemble the targeted Go binaries using Capstone to get the offsets of `ret` mnemonics.
Because `uretprobe` does not function properly in Go thanks to its unique ABI.

Lastly, we keep track of the Goroutine ID by using some offsets that we learn by looking at the DWARF table.

### Kernel

We [`kprobe`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/trace/kprobes.html) certain tracepoints in the kernel for reasons
like doing address resolution (by learning IP and port number for both source and destination) or for matching
request-response pairs.

While the methods explained in here sounds a little bit complicated the TLS sniffer has little to no performance
impact thanks to efficient eBPF in-kernel virtual machine of Linux and our carefully written C code. In any case,
Linux kernel does not allow injecting a huge number of instructions for probing purposes. So, the kernel's itself
guarantee no slowdown or crash.
