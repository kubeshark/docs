**Discover what's beneath the tip of the iceberg!**

**Kubeshark** is a simple-yet-powerful API traffic viewer for Kubernetes enabling you to view all API communication between microservices across multiple protocols to help your debug and troubleshoot regressions.

**Kubeshark** offers a real-time view of all HTTP requests, REST and gRPC API calls, as well as Kafka, AMQP (activeMQ / RabbitMQ), and Redis.

## Install Kubeshark

Install **Mizu** in your terminal:

### Mac (Intel)

```shell
curl -Lo mizu github.com/up9inc/mizu/releases/latest/download/mizu_darwin_amd64 && chmod 755 mizu 
```

This is the `docs` starter template. It contains all of the features that you need to build a Markdown-powered documentation site, including:

- ✅ **Full Markdown support**
- ✅ **Responsive mobile-friendly design**
- ✅ **Sidebar navigation**
- ✅ **Search (powered by Algolia)**
- ✅ **Multi-language i18n**
- ✅ **Automatic table of contents**
- ✅ **Automatic list of contributors**
- ✅ (and, best of all) **dark mode**

## Getting Started

To get started with this theme, check out the `README.md` in your new project directory. It provides documentation on how to use and customize this template for your own project. Keep the README around so that you can always refer back to it as you build.

Found a missing feature that you can't live without? Please suggest it on Discord [(#ideas-and-suggestions channel)](https://astro.build/chat) and even consider adding it yourself on GitHub! Astro is an open source project and contributions from developers like you are how we grow!

Good luck out there, Astronaut. 🧑‍🚀
