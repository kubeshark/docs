**Kubeshark** monitors and correlates events from the Kubernetes API server, the Linux operating system, and network interfaces to provide a comprehensive view of your cluster's activity.

**Kubeshark** supports all Kubernetes distributions and versions, including datacenter and cloud environments. It does not require any prerequisites such as [CNIs](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/kubernetes-networking/kubernetes-cni/), service meshes, or code instrumentation. It functions without the need for a proxy or sidecar and does not necessitate any changes to the existing architecture.

## Dashboard

**Kubeshark**'s dashboard is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application served via a port running on the `front` deployment. The `front` operates within the K8s control plane and communicates with the [Hub](#hub) via WebSocket, displaying captured traffic in real-time as a scrolling feed.

Once **Kubeshark** is deployed, access to the dashboard can be provided using one of the following methods:

1. **`port-forward`**: A Kubernetes functionality. The quickest method, yet the least recommended, as port-forward isn't performant and can break quickly.
2. **`kubeshark proxy`**: A [CLI](#cli) command that maintains a `kube-proxy` or a `port-forward` connection, attempting to re-establish the connection when it breaks.
3. **Ingress Controller**: The most recommended method. Stable, performant, and secure.

**Kubeshark** further supports integration with corporate Identity Providers (IDPs) using SAML for authentication and authorization.

## Hub

The **Hub** is a K8s deployment that consolidates all [Worker](#worker) streams into a single stream and relays that consolidated stream to the [Dashboard](#dashboard). It operates together with the [Dashboard](#dashboard) and only when there's an active [Dashboard](#dashboard) connection.

The **Hub** monitors the K8s API server and helps correlate those events with the rest of the events monitored by **Kubeshark** (e.g., network and Linux OS events).

## Worker

Workers perform the heavy lifting in **Kubeshark**. They operate continuously, independently from the [Hub](#hub) or the [Dashboard](#dashboard). They capture traffic from the network interface and monitor the Linux operating system. Traffic processing includes:

1. Capturing traffic from the network interface using either AF_PACKET or eBPF.
2. Dissecting the raw traffic and reassembling the packets into protocol-level messages.
3. Monitoring Linux OS events and correlating them with other events monitored by **Kubeshark**.
4. Execute custom network processors that continuously process traffic and trigger actions.

Worker pods are deployed into the cluster at the node level as [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/). Each DaemonSet includes two containers:

1. **Sniffer**: A network packet sniffer.
2. **Tracer**: An optional kernel tracer.

Workers also export custom metrics to Prometheus, which can be visualized in dashboards such as Grafana and Datadog.

### Sniffer

The Sniffer is the primary container in the Worker pod, responsible for capturing packets using AF_PACKET (when eBPF isn't enabled) and processing traffic up to fully reassembled messages.

### Tracer

The Tracer is responsible for tracing kernel-space and user-space functions using [eBPF](https://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bpf/) (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter). eBPF is an in-kernel virtual machine running programs passed from user space, first introduced in Linux kernel version 4.4 and matured since then.

This functionality, performed by the Tracer container, includes:

1. Capturing raw L4 traffic (a more robust alternative to using AF_PACKET).
2. Capturing TLS traffic.
3. Capturing syscalls.

Tracer deployment is optional and can be enabled or disabled using the `tap.tls` configuration value. When set to `false`, the Tracer won't be deployed.

### **Data Retention**  

Workers process data primarily in-memory, with some data stored on the local Workers' disk, which is **ephemeral by default**. Stored data is discarded after a pre-configured TTL (e.g., 10s, 5m). The entire Workers' storage is purged when the Workers' pods are evicted or uninstalled.  

> Read more about the TTL strategy [here](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/traffic_retention).  

Unless explicitly triggered by the user (e.g., through [scripting](/en/automation_scripting) and [integrations](/en/integration_kubeshark_logs)), **no data leaves the premises**.  


## CLI (kubeshark)

The CLI, a binary distribution of the **Kubeshark** client, is written in the [Go](https://go.dev/) language and typically named `kubeshark`. It is an optional component that offers a lightweight, on-demand option to use **Kubeshark** without leaving any permanent footprint.

Once downloaded, you can use the `tap` command to begin monitoring cluster-wide API traffic:

```shell
kubeshark tap                                       # tap all pods in all namespaces
kubeshark tap -n sock-shop "(catalo*|front-end*)"   # tap only pods that match the regex in a certain namespace
```
